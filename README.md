Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'blockchain' with 'my butt'

[Direct download of crx file](https://github.com/horohronos/blockchain-to-butt/blob/master/CloudToButt.crx?raw=true)

Note that there are forks of this extension that simply replace 'blockchain' with 'butt'.
In my personal opinion, that approach is too broad and it's less funny as a result, but it is clearly a very
polarizing issue in the blockchain-to-butt user community.  Forks are free to do whatever they like.  But officially, _this_ extension replaces only the phrase described above, and therefore it did not replace your cloudflare URLs with buttflare URLs. Thank you for your concern.

Installation
------------

In Chrome, choose Window > Extensions.  Drag BlockchainToButt.crx into the page that appears.
